"""
Write a function liquid_distribution that distributes a hazardous liquid between special bottles.
The function accepts two parameters:
liters: integer
bottle_sizes: list

You have access to an unlimited amount of bottles of each of the provided sizes.
You must fill every chosen bottle completely.

Your function must return the minimum number of bottles needed to distribute all of the liquid.

Examples:
For liters = 18 and bottles = [1, 2, 5, 10],
the output should be
liquid_distribution(liters, bottles) = 4.

You have access to bottles with sizes 10, 5, 2, and 1, and will use one bottle of each size.

For liters = 9 and bottles = [1, 4, 6],
the output should be
liquid_distribution(liters, bottles) = 3.

You can use two bottles of size 4 and one bottle of size 1.

If there's no way to distribute the liquid as described above, return -1 instead.
